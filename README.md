# 🚀 Digital Marketing Strategist | Growth & Tech-Ops

### Marketing First. Technology Powered.
**By Kevin Daza** | *Digital Marketing Director & Growth Architect*

Welcome! 👋 I am a **Performance Marketer** who speaks the language of engineering.

My core value is not just "running ads" or "writing blogs." It is designing comprehensive **Customer Journey Maps (CJM)** that generate emotional connections and, ultimately, **Revenue ($)**.

What makes me unique? While other marketers depend on IT teams to execute their vision, **I build my own infrastructure.** I use AI and Automation (n8n/Python) to scale the strategies that I design.

## 🎯 My Strategic Core: The "Pain-to-Revenue" Framework

Before any tool is touched, I execute my proprietary strategy based on consumer psychology:

1.  **Deep Market Understanding:**
    * Defining **ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)** and **Buyer Persona** with surgical precision.
2.  **Pain Points Extraction:**
    * I identify the real problems keeping the persona awake at night.
3.  **The "Key Questions" Method (SEO Core):**
    * I translate every Pain Point into specific **Key Questions** the user is asking Google.
    * *Strategy:* My content answers these questions better than anyone else.
4.  **Emotional Connection:**
    * By addressing their specific reality, we build trust. Trust leads to transactions.
5.  **Generating Money ($):**
    * The result is a high-converting funnel where technology facilitates a sale that was already won strategically.

## 🧠 The Revenue Architecture

This is how I visualize the path from a "Stranger" to "Revenue", powered by Strategy + Tech:

    B -->|Builds Trust| C[Landing Page with Solution];
    end
    
    subgraph "Conversion Engine"
    C -->|Fills Form| D{Qualified by Strategy?};
    D -- Yes --> E[Sync to Zoho/HubSpot];
    E --> F[AI Agent Engages Instantly];
    F --> G[Sales Call Booked];
    end
